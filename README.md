# What is this?

A very simple Turbo-Flask [a link](https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/turbo-flask) Python example.
Turbo-Flask uses the HotWIRE JS (turbo.js) library to update sections/divs using WebSockets.
No need for tons of front-end JS code on the page - inspect the code and see for yourself.
This app just generates a random person's name every 3 seconds using Faker in a div.
This code can be used by Python programmers as a reference template for Web-app projects that require async update from various threads.
