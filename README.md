# What is this?

A very simple Turbo-Flask Python example.
Turbo-Flask uses the HotWIRE JS (turbo.js) library to update sections/divs using WebSockets.
No need for tons of front-end JS code on the page - inspect the code and see for yourself.
This app just generates a random person's name every 3 seconds using Faker in a div.

## Installation

Just satisfy requirements.txt; code tested with Python3 on Chrome

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
